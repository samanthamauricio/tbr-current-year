        <p><h1>My TBR of 2025</h1></p>
        <p></p>

        Last year I felt overwhelmed by all the new authors, must-reads, tier lists and tropes that suddenly appeared in the 
        book community as a result of Book Tok, so I <em>decided</em> to read all of the books that won the Goodreads Choice
        Award in the last few years. And that... obviously and unfortunately... did not happen.  
        <p>That being said, even if I did not succeed in reading 45 books, I can proudly say that there wasn't a single
            month in the year in which I wasn't reading at least one book. And that's more than a lot of people can say.
        </p>
        The genres that I enjoy the most are Romance, Romantasy and Fantasy, so those were the categories that I wanted to read 
        the most. I was aiming to read not just the winner of the Goodreads choice awards, but also the second and third
        place for those categories, in case the winner was part of a series. Ultimately, the books I added to my TBR were 
        the following:
