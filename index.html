        <p><h1>My reading goals for 2025</h1></p>
        By the end of last year I went back to reading, so I was very ambicious with my reading goal for this year.
        While I didn't reach my goal, I managed to stay consistent throughout the year, especially due to the Book club.
        My full TBR is available on the page below, as well as a section with more information on the Book club.
        <p></p>
        <h3><a href="book-club.html" target="_blank">Book club</a> </h3>
        <h3><a href="tbr.html" target="_blank">To be read</a> </h3>

        <p></p>
        I had set myself a goal of 45 books, which seemed pretty <em>reasonable</em> last year, but became really impossible
        considering the turns my life took this year. <strong>So I ultimately changed that goal to 25 books</strong>
        from the following genres:
            <ol>
                <li>Fantasy</li>
                <li>Historical fiction</li>
                <li>Contemporary romance</li>
                <li>New adult</li>
                <li>Romantasy</li>
                <li>Science Fiction</li>
                <li>Crime</li>
                <li>Thriller</li>
                <li>Fiction</li>
                <li>Horror</li>
            </ol>


        <p><h2>Some of the books I read this year:</h2></p>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>The Invisible life of Addie LaRue</h4></li>

                    and he grants it under the condition that she will be immediately forgotten as soon as she is out of
                    sight. She lives like that for 300 years until she meets a boy who, for some reason, remembers her.</p>
