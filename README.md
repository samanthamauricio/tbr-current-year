Basic website with my TBR list of 2025

This was my first short project for The Odin Project. It was supposed to be a recipe list to put in practice the concepts of HTML learned, so that we can also, later on, put into practice the CSS section. However, I wanted to create a project that I could actually use in the future, like a basic TBR list. Therefore, this is meant as a simple project which I may go back to in the future to apply new concepts as I learn them. 

In this page, I will create a basic website with absolute and relative links, add text, images, and add (ordered and unordered) lists.
